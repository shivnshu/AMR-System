1. Build a server on the mobile which broadcasts sensor data.
2. Stop the server whenever no client is connected to conserve battery.
3. Use UDP protocol to broadcast data on the LAN, clients can connect and receive the data.
4. Check whether broadcasting the message will be better.
5. Run the udp server broadcasting code in a loop in a seperate thread.
6. Calibration of the data, fusing of gyroscope and magnetometer data.
7. Open connection on a particular UDP port.


TODO:

1. Read sensor data on the device.
2. Transmit the UDP packets.
